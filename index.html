  <h2>Nothing else matters</h2>
  <a>So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else matters</a>
  <a>Never opened myself this way Life is ours, we live it our way All these words I don't just say And nothing else matters</a>
  <a> Trust I seek and I find in you Every day for us something new Open mind for a different view And nothing else matters</a>
  <a>Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know But I know</a>
  <a>So close no matter how far It couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are And nothing else matters</a>
  <a>Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know But I know</a>

  <a>Never cared for what they say Never cared for games they play Never cared for what they do Never cared for what they know And I know, yeah</a>
  <a>So close no matter how far Couldn't be much more from the heart Forever trusting who we are No, nothing else matters</a>
